# Automatic Download Obfuscation

> Often times we have seen many webpages download files without explicitly asking for our permission to download. In this repo a simple proof of concept has been implemented in order to show this kind of scenario.

- A fork bomb code is compiled for different platforms and the raw bytes have been obfuscated using Base64, further obfuscation is also possible with any other techniques...but here its just an example.
- It's not made with malicious intent, please maintain ethics and use it for testing purposes only.
